####
Hi, what's up? My name is Vinicius, but you can call me Vini 🐝

I work as a Data Engineer, with 3+ years of experience in the field. However, I also dabble in Front-end Development whenever needed. I'm passionate about delivering top-notch solutions and always eager to lend a hand to the team, whether it's crafting data pipelines or coding for the front-end.

Here in this repository you will find insane and surprising codes, not only from Data Engineering, but other areas as well!
